    "This project is named __Baby Notes__. it is a simple educational app designed for children below the age of five. The project makes use of machine learning to supervise kids while they learn to write numbers.\n",

    "__Reasons for using deep learning__\n",
    "* To enconrage children to write naturally without any smoothing software since deep learning model can easily recognise a number even when written in a slightly different way. \n",
    "* It is a fun way to introduce children to what artificial intelligence will can do as regards there education as they grow.\n",
    "* It eliminates the needs for parent supervision while the child write since the deep learning model can recognise the number writen no matter the orientation the device was held while writting.\n",

    "The child is expected to write into the box provided as shown in the image above either with the finger or with a pen if the phone provides one. The number is the captured and saved as image into a database and the *image_path* is then passed to the deep learning model as show in the code below which predicts the number.\n",
